🎯 Lesson Goal

By the end of this exercise, students will be able to:

Identify what makes a good scenario.

Rewrite a regular text requirement into structured Gherkin syntax.

Collaborate as a QA or developer team (like in Jira BDD tickets).

🧠 What is Gherkin Language?

Gherkin is a simple, structured language used to describe software behavior.
It’s used in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to make requirements easy to test and understand.

It follows this structure:

Feature: <short description>
  Scenario: <what you’re testing>
    Given <the starting situation>
    When <an action occurs>
    Then <the expected result>


Each line starts with a keyword:

Feature: describes the functionality being tested.

Scenario: one example or test case for that feature.

Given: the starting conditions (setup).

When: the action being performed.

Then: the expected outcome.

👩‍🏫 Lesson Plan for 6 Students
Step 1️⃣ – Start with Plain Text

Give students regular text requirements like these:

A user should be able to log in with a valid username and password.

If the user enters a wrong password, an error message should appear.

A logged-in user can view their profile page.

Users should be able to search for hotels by city name.

Users can cancel a booking from their bookings page.

Staff can check pets in when they arrive at the PetHotel.

Step 2️⃣ – Assign One Requirement per Student

Each student takes one requirement and rewrites it in Gherkin format.

Example conversion:

📝 Regular text:

A user should be able to log in with a valid username and password.

✅ Gherkin version:
Feature: User Login
  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When they enter a valid username and password
    Then they should be redirected to their dashboard

Step 3️⃣ – Group Review

Each student shares their Gherkin scenario.
The rest of the group checks:

Does it include Given, When, and Then?

Does it describe behavior (what happens) instead of implementation (how it happens)?

Is it clear and testable?

Encourage feedback like:

“I think your Given could describe the page setup better.”
“Can you make your Then step more specific about the outcome?”

Step 4️⃣ – Add More Scenarios Together

Ask each student to add one negative scenario (what happens when something goes wrong).

Example:

Scenario: Login fails with invalid password
  Given the user is on the login page
  When they enter a valid username but an incorrect password
  Then an error message should appear saying "Invalid credentials"

Step 5️⃣ – Enter Scenarios into Jira

Once everyone has their scenarios:

Create a Jira project (e.g., PetHotel BDD Training).

Add each Feature as a User Story.

Add the Scenario text in Gherkin format in the story’s description or “Test” issue.

Assign each student as the author of one scenario.

💡 Tips to Remember

Keep sentences short and specific.

One Scenario = one behavior to test.

Avoid UI or technical details like button colors or database names.

Use consistent names for users, pages, and actions.

🎓 Example Group Result (after practice)
Feature: Pet Check-In
  Scenario: Successfully checking in a pet
    Given the staff is logged into the PetHotel system
    And the pet has a valid booking for today
    When the staff marks the pet as "Checked In"
    Then the system should update the booking status to "Active"
